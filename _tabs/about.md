~ A place to let the voices speak ~

I think that I can vouch for everybody when I say that sometimes it can all get too much. With a world of inhaling information this is my exhale. All posts are my thoughts and are almost entirely unedited. I would like to keep all thoughts raw and pure.

Things to note 
- Take everything stated with a grain of salt, these are all just opinions that I may have experienced at different times and at different states of mind. Times change, people change, and states of mind change, with it opinions change. 
- There will be things stated here that to various degrees I may not currently agree with, but I belive that it is still nevertheless important to post such things with an open mind to see the full perspective.
- This is just an unfiltered frame of a perspective in time. This is not me. Just as much as a frame is not a movie, a perspective is not a person. 
- If you feel like I have been misguided, misinformed or truly ignorant email me and I might write a new post about said topic.

Enjoy
