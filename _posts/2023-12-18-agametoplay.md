## People of the free
In the realm of 21st-century first-world living, the autonomy and power bestowed upon us in our daily lives beg the question: are we truly ready for this level of freedom?

We as people of the 21st century first world country are not yet ready for the power and autonomy we are given with respect to our daily lives. While many would regard this comment as anti freedom, but we should first ask what does free mean. Do we really want free? Is a completely free market genuinely liberating? Is an unpoliced state truly free? Is a society in which anybody can go around raping and killing anybody in there sight a free state. 

My stance is this: I don't believe we are ready for the daily freedom we are given by ourselves to ourselves. This is not a statement about society but an observation about our collective maturity in terms of out own personal philosophical intention and direction.

Experiencing both the liberty of being a young university student in Australia, it is no underestimation that the world is my oyster. We are told from the second we are born that we are not even bound by the laws of physics. That whoever we want to be, we can be. Now this optimism seems all and good until the realisation sets in that if we don't become who we want to become it is completely and directly our fault. If life cant stop us, only us can stop us. 

## The old ways
While reflecting on my grandparents old fashioned values it has come to my realisation that I had felt the most fulfilled and happy when given fundamental responsibilities. As a child of a predominantly Polish family, freedom has a nuanced meaning. From the invasion of Nazi Germany to the soviet occupation of Poland my extensive family are no stranger to societal subjugation. 

Yet it often seems that responsibilities and freedom are opposing principles. With this modern lack of specifically needing to do anything and provided with the freedom of doing what we want to do when we want to do, it is truly a confronting concept. 


As a person of my generation I have become, a stranger to responsibility, a stranger to religion, a stranger to pride, for now I am a stranger to meaning. 

With Camus and his absurdist views he provides an answer to this in a passive sense, a way to look at the artwork of life but the real question is what do I do today, tomorrow or even next week. Frankl put it well though; we need a sense of reasoning, we need a purpose, we need a task.

## The need to play
Abstractly life in many ways is a game and we need a game to play, some play by the rules, others cheat and some excel but a game nevertheless. Without a game even cheating becomes irrelevant. This game is always synonymous with responsibility, if it is being a mother, a father, a friend, or even a career like that of an engineer. We all play games. Without a game there is nothing. There is distraction, ignorance and pleasure. We have to suffer in the game, it has to be tough, enduring and frustrating. But not to worry, you feel this because we care. we care about achieving greatness. 

As we nostalgically romanticize and long for simpler times, it becomes evident that the intricacies of life are anything but simple. The question arises: do we truly desire this much self inflicted freedom? Perhaps what we need are responsibilities, for in responsibilities lies a game to play, a game that may provide direction, purpose and meaning.
