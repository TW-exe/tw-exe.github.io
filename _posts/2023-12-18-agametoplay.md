## People of the free
We as people of the 21st century first world country are not yet ready for the power and autonomy we are given with respect to our daily lives. Most would regard this as anti freedom, but we should first ask what does free mean. Do we really want free? Is a completely free market free? Is an unpoliced state free? Is a society in which anybody can go around raping and killing anybody in there sight a free state. 

My stance is this I don't believe we as people are not ready for the daily freedom we are given by ourselves to ourselves. This is not a statement about society but our maturity of our own personal philosophical intention and direction.

Experiencing both the freedom of being a young university student in Australia, it is no underestimation that the world is my oyster. We are told from the second we are born that we are not even bound by the laws of physics. That whoever we want to be, we can be. Now this seems all good until the realisation that if you don't become who you want to become it is completely and directly your fault. If life cant stop you, only you can stop you. 

## The old ways
While also experiencing the flavour of my grandparents old fashioned values it has come to my realisation that I had felt the most fulfilled and happy when given fundamental responsibilities. As a child of a predominantly Polish family, freedom has a nuanced meaning. From the invasion of Nazi Germany to the soviet occupation of Poland my extensive family are no stranger to a full societal subjugation. 

Yet it often seems that responsibilities and freedom are opposing principles. With this modern lack of needing to do anything and provided with the freedom of doing what we want to do when we want to do, it is truly a confronting concept. As a person of my generation I have become, a stranger to responsibility, a stranger to religion, a stranger to pride, for now I am a stranger to meaning. 

With Camus and his absurdist views he provides an answer to this in a passive sense a way to look at the artwork of life but the real question is what do I do today, tomorrow or even next week. Frankl put it well though, we need this reasoning, we need this purpose, we need this task.

## The need to play
Abstractly we need a game to play, some play by the rules, some cheat and some are good but a game nevertheless. You cant even cheat if there is no game to play. This game is a responsibility. Being a mother, a father, a friend, or even a career like an engineer. We all play games. Without a game there is nothing. There is distraction, ignorance and pleasure. We have to suffer in the game, it has to be tough, enduring and frustrating. But not to worry, you feel this because you care. You care about being great. 

Why do we romanticize a long for simpler times?

Its all very complicated, I don't know if I want this much self inflicted freedom, I need responsibilities, for I need a game to play.
