A man that thinks of nothing but his own thoughts slides down the slope of illusion and looses touch with reality, everything seems fine in the valley of his own mind but a dark fog hide the horrors of what is real. He walks towards a murky puddle and seeâ€™s nothing but a man better than the rest, eyes as healthy as young but still blind, the formations of truth and lie merge like a drunk mans speech. The tricks he plays on himself become a normality and comfort becomes his drug of choice. Nothing but his own mind can rescue him from such depth of darkness and despair. Careful now, as such beast lies dormant in every valley, waiting for an opportunity to strike.
