# Animal, Man and God

What does it mean to be a god? In an Abrahamic sense, it is the being with the almighty “power”, the “knowledge” of all and the infinite capability “to do”. In an eastern sense, especially through the lens of Buddhism, such main themes are still present without the need for a supernatural presence; such capabilities are executed by a man named Siddhartha Gautama. Initially, one may question such a claim that a man can be compared to god. Still, if you look deeply into what such themes mean, one will soon realise that the pillars of virtue that constitute gods are not too different to the man named Siddhartha. More importantly, that insinuates that all men have the capabilities of constructing such pillars. Therefore the correct question to ask is what differentiates man from god and animal from man.


The latter can be explained through our in depth and complex self awareness and consciousness. It seems evident that no other animal is as aware as us humans. This consciousness provides us with a wide array of gifts and torturous punishments, as we are bound by both. If such consciousness is used correctly, the gift given is the ability to look at the world through both collective and subjective perspectives allowing us to correctly define the world around us. Such interpretations of the world are given a language, a language that is used to further interpret the world from the infinite spans of the macro and micro lens. We know this as science or, more broadly, knowledge.

  
# Contradictions
Yet the torturous punishment that comes with such consciousness is the contradiction that occurs between our remaining animal like instincts and the awareness of what is good and bad. Man has the capability to define what is good and bad even if such definition is constantly changing. We use the language of science, to uncover and interpret more and more intricate information about the reality that is presented around us and make respective decisions. To understand what is good and bad is to understand what is reality. Yet with all this information, humans still suffer the burden of not aligning oneself to the truths that lay before him. Man knows what to do, yet he doesn’t do it; he has the knowledge yet lacks the will. In the modern world, he lives eternally in the valley of despair, defining life as suffering and knowing he cannot do what is right and wrong even though he knows the truth. Then what about god?

  
# Gods will
God only knows little more than man, regarding reality, yet with such information, he is not bounded by the limitations of the will that humans suffer from. God has the capability of not only knowing right from wrong but respectfully practising such propositions. Now as we look back to the pillars that constitute god, it becomes clear that the “knowledge” of all and the infinite capability “to do” respectfully manifests such almighty “power”. Then what about Siddhartha? Where does the god-like man fit into the equation? Throughout the religious scripts of the story of Buddha, Siddhartha reached enlightenment through the practice of meditation under a sacred fig tree, yet what does this idea of enlightenment propose?

  
# Enlightenment
This idea of enlightenment was that through deep mediation, he reached a level of consciousness or awareness that nothing, in reality, was associated with with his subconscious, nothing is ever good or bad as we define it through emotions. Everything is simply the way it is. Siddhartha then saw the world through a new lens, the grass was greener, the water was clearer, and everything had a symbiotic beauty to it. No longer was the rush of life, the pressure of society and the fog of his emotions poisoning his perspective. He had reached nirvana. Yet through such enlightenment, he is no longer bounded by his subconscious and his respective emotions. He can think nothing but consciousness or logic. Therefore he is no longer bounded by the torturous punishment that comes with awareness. Siddhartha was so aware that he was no longer bound by his emotions. He could then respectfully have complete free will, subsiding all his desires. This is why Siddhartha is given a god-like prowess and is not too different to the gods above. So what does this mean for man?

  

It is evident through the Buddhist stories that Siddhartha became enlightened through thinking long enough through meditation, yet most men do not have such a capability. Is this the answer, that enlightenment provides happiness as one becomes free, truly free from oneself, with no shackles holding them down? In a Nietzschean sense, one has the capability to become one’s own Übermensch. Unlike Siddhartha, man cannot eliminate the animalistic desires that remain from our ancestral ape origin. We are still bounded by such feelings but through the exercise of discipline one can fight such desires and choose the right path. This is the biblically archetypal son of god, Jesus, the man that could fight all his desires to make the right decisions.

  

To conclude, to understand what is right is simply a matter of information. To do what is right is a matter of consciousness and free will. Understanding what is right is passive. The answers float to the top, while for man to do what is right is an active procedure that challenges everyman every day. The secret to happiness is not pleasure, and it is not suffering. It is being who you want to be. It is becoming one's own god. As ironic as it seems, we are not too different from Siddhartha and not too different from gods. This is the human enlightenment. This provides man with joy in life no matter the situation. Once we have control of our thoughts and emotions, we have control of our perspective which, as we define it, changes the world around us.
